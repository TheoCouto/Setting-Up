# Setting Up

## Objectives
*You must find the largest possible square on a board while avoiding obstacles.*

The board can be obtained two ways:

1. Reading file
The first one is by reading a file passed as the program's argument.

2. Generating your own
The second way to obtain a board is to generate one based on given parameters. The parameters will be a number, representing the width and height of the board, and a pattern that will be reapeated line by line along the board.

Your program must print the solved board, with some **"."** replaced by **"x"** to represent the largest square you found.
