# Setting Up

## About the Project
- EPITECH *First Year* Project (2023)
- **Module:** Elementary Programming in C
- **Duration:** 3 weeks (04/11/2023 - 24/11/2023)
- **Solo** Project

---------------------------

## Objectives
**You must find the largest possible square on a board while avoiding obstacles.**

The board can be obtained two ways:
### 1. Reading file
The first one is by reading a file passed as the program's argument.

### 2. Generating your own
The second way to obtain a board is to generate one based on given parameters. The parameters will be a number, representing the width and height of the board, and a pattern that will be reapeated line by line along the board.

Your program must print the solved board, with some **"."** replaced by **"x"** to represent the largest square you found.
